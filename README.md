# dotfiles-installer

### A dotfiles installation tool, making installing someone's dotfiles seemless! 
___Provided they use the correct format.___ 

[//]: # (make formatting page documenting how to package dotfiles on github so the installer can install it seemlessly)

[//]: # (focus on this later as i wanna make it work with dwm-mko first as a test)

# dwm-mko

My [Heavily Patched DWM Configuration](https://github.com/gitmko/dwm-mko) built with [dwm-flexipatch](https://github.com/bakkeby/dwm-flexipatch)

### At the moment, this installer is made to only work with my configuration, support will be added in the future for other configurations.
